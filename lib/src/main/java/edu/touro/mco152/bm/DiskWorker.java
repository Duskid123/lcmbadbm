/**
 * Run the disk benchmarking exclusively as a Swing-compliant thread (only one of these threads can run at
 * once.) Must cooperate with Swing to provide and make use of interim and final progress and
 * information, which is also recorded as needed to the persistence store, and log.
 * <p>
 * Depends on static values that describe the benchmark to be done having been set in App and Gui classes.
 * The DiskRun class is used to keep track of and persist info about each benchmark at a higher level (a run),
 * while the DiskMark class described each iteration's result, which is displayed by the UI as the benchmark run
 * progresses.
 * <p>
 * This class only knows how to do 'read' or 'write' disk benchmarks, all of which is done in doInBackground(). It is instantiated by the
 * startBenchmark() method.
 * <p>
 * To be Swing compliant this class extends SwingWorker and is dependant on it. It declares that its final return (when
 * doInBackground() is finished) is of type Boolean, and declares that intermediate results are communicated to
 * Swing using an instance of the DiskMark class.
